This is a description of what the paper is.

GNU Make and Makefiles
----------------------

The paper you are currently reading was assembled using a Makefile. By
running a Makefile a user can execute a program

By writing a Makefile and executing it with GNU Make, a user can
automate the command line.

Makefiles encourage reproducibility by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

"**GNU Make** is a tool which controls the generation of executables and
other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.
Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called
the *makefile*, which lists each of the non-source files and how to
compute it from other files. \[1\]".

For example, if yo

Created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, *Markdown* is a simple
markup language with plain text that can be converted to HTML \[2\].
Markdown encourages reproducibility through its simplicity and
readability - Markdown documents can be read as-is, as opposed to Rich
Text Formals and HTML, where words are surrounded by tags and
formatting.Take a look at the example below:

#### Output

Text attributes *italic*, *italic*, **bold**, **bold**, `monospace`.

#### HTML Language

``` {.html}
<p>Text attributes <em>italic</em>, <em>italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>bold</strong>, <code>monospace</code>.</p>
```

#### Markdown Language

``` {.markdown}
Text attributes _italic_, *italic*, __bold__, **bold**, `monospace`.
```

Clearly, Markdown language is easier to read. As a result, README files
are often written in Markdown, making it easier for users to understand
instructions and reproduce them.
