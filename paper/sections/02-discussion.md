##GNU Make and Makefiles

The paper you are currently reading was assembled using a Makefile.
By running a Makefile a user can execute a program 

By writing a Makefile and executing it with GNU Make, a user can automate the command line.

Makefiles encourage reproducibility by ____________.


"**GNU Make** is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files. Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the *makefile*, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files. [1]".

Created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, *Markdown* is a simple markup language with plain text that can be converted to HTML [2]. Markdown encourages reproducibility through its simplicity and readability - Markdown documents can be read as-is, as opposed to Rich Text Formals and HTML, where words are surrounded by tags and formatting.Take a look at the example below:




####Output
Text attributes _italic_, *italic*, __bold__, **bold**, `monospace`.
  
####HTML Language
```html
<p>Text attributes <em>italic</em>, <em>italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>bold</strong>, <code>monospace</code>.</p>
```
####Markdown Language
```markdown
Text attributes _italic_, *italic*, __bold__, **bold**, `monospace`.
```

Clearly, Markdown language is easier to read. As a result, README files are often written in Markdown, making it easier for users to understand instructions and reproduce them.
