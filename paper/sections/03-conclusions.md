Work is reproducible if any user can re-create it using the same original data with the same methods and outputting the same results. Reproducibility is an imperative first step in proving the validity of any result. In order for collaborative projects to be reproducible, programmers with the spirit of Open Science have created free, open-source tools Markdown, Pandoc, Git/Github, and Make, all of which improve the structure, speed, and organization of Data Analysis projects. Open Science is a movement towards making all projects freely available online to encourage the sharing of knowledge for advancement. As a result of this movement and the creation of such tools, anyone can reproduce work and take part in advancing the field of Statistical Data Analysis.

##About My Experience with this Project
My initial challenge was mastering the use of Git, which happened quickly after attending the Office Hour of GSI Sindhuja. Writing the Makefile was fun, as the tutorial written by Professor Gaston Sanchez was excellent and easy to follow. 

I actually found the most difficult part to be writing the contents of the paper in a way that is clear and easy to understand. I realize that it is an essential skill for collaborative projects and tutorials I could post on my own website (in development at the moment).
