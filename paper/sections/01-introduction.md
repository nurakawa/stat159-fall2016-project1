__What is reproducibility?__  
Put simply, _reproducibility_ is the ability for anyone to re-create his own or another person's work. This could be something as simple as a data-cleaning script or as complex as a computer operating system. An experiment is reproducible if any researcher can obtain the same results using the same original data and following the same outlined procedures.  

__Why is reproducibility important?__  
The results of an experiment are useful if and only if they are reproducible. Inevitably, statistical analysis involves randomness and noise that can impact results. Reproducing results is a way of validating them and minimizing the impact of uncontrollable variables.
  
>"...reproducibility is important not because it ensures that the results are correct, but rather because it ensures transparency and gives us confidence in understanding exactly what was done.[1]"

The requirement of reproducibility also places a check on accidental results, careless errors, or falsifications. Researchers are forced to work meticulously and in an organized manner such that their work can be repeated by others, or themselves. It also allows for experimental results to be used in industry settings with higher confidence of success.     

__What makes work reproducible?__
While there do not exist strict guidelines, reproducible works share the following characteristics:  

1)	They are publically available and accessible.

Open-source data and programs ensure that no researcher is inhibited from collaboration and reproduction of work due to lack of accessiblity. 


2)	They are easy to read and to understand. [markdown]
3)	They are well-organized and centralized and do not rely heavily on technology.[git] 

Work that is not well-organized and kept in a centrallized location becomes difficult to replicate. In addition, material that is heavily dependent on specific technologies exclude populations (for example, programs that run only on Windows operating systems exclude users of Linux or IOS).




__What is Open Science, and how does it encourage reproducibility?__  

_Open Science_ encourages researchers to make the entirety of their work - data, methods, and computer scripts - publically available. Work that is open can be reproduced easily. 

>"Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.[2]"  

This idea has fostered the creation of open-source (meaning that all source code and documentation is freely available online) tools that encourage the practice of Open Science and ultimately enable reproducibility. This paper discusses several of these recent developments and explores how they facilitate reproducibility and contribute to Open Science.
